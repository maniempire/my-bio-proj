I have full command in Ruby on Rails, Rspec, Cucumber, Twitter bootstrap framework, Sass, Haml, Javascript, Coffeescript, jQuery, Stripe, Devise, MySQL, PostgreSQL etc. Earlier I also worked with mid to enterprise Java/J2EE framework.<br/>

	<br/>
			In the last 5 years I have been leading startup teams from end to end management of clients, projects, team management and hands on architecture using agile development approach. I'm very well versed with lean startup approach from proof of concept phase to launch phase.
	<br/>
			I value my time and my clients time and  I guarantee high quality work and on-time delivery. I believe in open communication and can help entrepreneurs/startups to polish/refine, brain storm ideas. <br/>

			Also, I believe in writing beautiful, maintainable code - every line purposeful, and every method focused and concise.
